# ODE-Phase-Response

With this project I am developing an ODE class with methods capable of choosing pulses which optimize phase response.

Disclaimer: This project is NOT complete! Please feel free to use it, but do so at your own risk of problems such as syntax errors, worthless or missing comments, and inifinite loops.

Project Description: This goal of this project is to finalize the ODE class such that it is capable of determining the optimal phase response curve for an ODE combining the direct method as well as a method which utilizes the infinitesimal phase response curve (iPRC). Defining the ODE model and specifying likely parameters to be affected by a pulse as well as experimental PRC data, the program will determine the amplitudes for which each parameter should be increased during the pulse to create the most accurate PRC.
